.SH NAME
simple_shell \- simple UNIX command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
.br
.B echo
\fI"command"\fR |
.B simple_shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a simple UNIX command line interpreter that reads commands from standard input and executes them. It provides a basic interactive shell environment similar to
.BR sh (1).
The shell can execute commands found in directories listed in the PATH environment variable, as well as commands specified with absolute or relative paths.

.SH USAGE
The shell works in both interactive and non-interactive mode. In interactive mode, it displays a prompt ":) " and waits for user input. In non-interactive mode, it reads commands from a pipe or file.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell with status 0.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
When a command is entered, the shell:
.IP 1. 3
Searches for the command in PATH directories
.IP 2. 3
If found, executes the command in a child process
.IP 3. 3
Waits for the command to complete
.IP 4. 3
Displays the prompt again (interactive mode)

.SH PATH RESOLUTION
Commands without a slash (/) are searched for in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable. Commands with a slash are treated as absolute or relative paths.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The shell returns the exit status of the last executed command. If a command is not found, it returns 127.

.SH ERROR HANDLING
If a command cannot be found, the shell prints an error message in the format:
.RS
.nf
simple_shell: 1: command_name: not found
.fi
.RE
and returns exit status 127.
